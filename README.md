## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected
_before_ starting this project.**

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps you and any
collaborators in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of
reasons.

### Description

In this project you'll take this crypto currency tracker app and build two
custom hooks that, when composed together, will allow users to set and persist a
dark mode preference.[TODO: Changes for every project]

## Project Set Up

- Checkout the project to your computer using `git clone [TODO: Add URL here]`
- CD into the project root directory `cd TODO: Add folder name here`
- Download project dependencies by running `npm install`
- Start up the app using `npm start`

After this is complete, the application will be deployed on port `3000`. Open a
browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`.

## Project Completion Instructions

Please open the project files locally and start making changes by following the
instructions. Read through the comments and you should be able to write up the
solution.

If you have any confusion you can refer to the solution in the learning portal.

<!-- Sample Project Completion Instructions Start -->

- Your todo list should display a list of todos, an input field, a submit button
- Be sure to use the given files for building out these components.
- <App /> will hold all the data needed for this project. It will also be the
  container for your Todo Components. All of your application data will be
  stored here on <App />. All of your handler functions should live here on
  <App />.
- <TodoList /> receives your Todos array and iterates over the list generating a
  new <Todo /> for each element in the array.
- <Todo /> is a component that takes in the todo data and displays the task to
  the screen.
- <TodoForm> will hold your input field and your Add Todo button.
- Your input field should take in user input, and allow a user to press Enter or
  click on the Submit Button to add a todo to your list.
- Once a todo is submitted, the Todo List should re-render and show the added
  todo.

### Project Comment Guide

Most comments in the project files start with one of the below signs. This is to
help you understand what you should do to the code immediately following these
comments.

üèÜ - **Trophy** - Describes the overall goal of the exercise. You can find this
at the top of the exercise file.

üí° - **Light Bulb** - General information regarding the code immediately
following this comment. You might find it throughout the code. No action is
required on your part, just read them.

‚úèÔ∏è - **Pencil** - You are supposed to edit the code immediately following this
comment. It is followed by a description of the change that you need to do.

üß≠ - **Compass** - When the description of change is not enough, the compass
will give you more direction. You will find it alongside the pencil when more
elaborate instruction is deemed necessary.

üö® - **Alarm** - This means danger. Read the comment carefully. Usually, it's
used to say you shouldn't change the code immediately following this. It will
create havoc.

### Tips to Keep in Mind (TODO: Add Tips if any specific to this project)

- All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.
- The components should be named App.js, TodoList.js and Todo.js (as those are
  the files being imported into the tests).
